                Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are recognized by their long trunks, large ears, and tusks. Elephants are highly intelligent and social creatures, living in matriarchal family groups. They are herbivores and spend most of their day eating grasses, fruits, and bark.
                <p>
                    Elephants are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their ivory tusks. Conservation programs focus on protecting their habitats and preventing illegal hunting.
