                <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                <p>
                    The elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>Elephas maximus</em>) is the largest existing land animal. Elephants are known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and distinctive trunks.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Native to Africa and Asia, with African elephants found in sub-Saharan Africa and Asian elephants in South and Southeast Asia.</li>
                    <li>Easily recognised by their massive bodies, large ears (especially in African species), and long, muscular trunks.</li>
                    <li>Body length: up to 7.5 m (24 ft); Weight: up to 6,000 kg (13,200 lb).</li>
                    <li>Thick, grey skin with sparse hair and large, curved tusks (in most males and some females).</li>
                    <li>African elephants are larger with bigger ears, while Asian elephants are smaller with rounded ears.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Elephants inhabit savannas, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivores, feeding on grasses, leaves, bark, and fruit. Elephants are highly social, living in matriarchal family groups and communicating with a variety of vocalisations and body language.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Live in herds led by the oldest female, known as the matriarch.</li>
                    <li>Strong bonds between family members; young are cared for by the entire herd.</li>
                    <li>Use their trunks for feeding, drinking, social interaction, and bathing.</li>
                    <li>Gestation lasts about 22 months, the longest of any land mammal.</li>
                    <li>Threatened by habitat loss and poaching for ivory.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong>
                <p>
                    You will find the elephants near the main entrance, across from the lion enclosure.
