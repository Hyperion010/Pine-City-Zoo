                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Giraffe</strong> (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its long neck, legs, and unique coat patterns make it easy to recognize. Giraffes belong to the family <strong>Giraffidae</strong>, along with the okapi. There are nine subspecies, each with different coat patterns.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                    Giraffes are found from <strong>Chad</strong> in the north to <strong>South Africa</strong> in the south, and from <strong>Niger</strong> in the west to <strong>Somalia</strong> in the east. They live in <strong>savannahs</strong>, <strong>grasslands</strong>, and <strong>open woodlands</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their main food is <strong>acacia leaves</strong>, which they can reach thanks to their height.

                    <strong>Lions</strong> are the main predators of giraffes. Calves may also be hunted by <strong>leopards</strong>, <strong>spotted hyenas</strong>, and <strong>African wild dogs</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giraffes do not form strong social groups, but may gather in loose herds. Males fight for dominance by swinging their necks, and the winners get to mate with females.

                    <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find the giraffes at <strong>G15</strong>, just beyond the research centre.
