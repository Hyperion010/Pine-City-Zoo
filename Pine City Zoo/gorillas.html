                    Elephants are the largest existing land animals, known for their intelligence, memory, and strong social bonds. The family <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is divided into three species: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants are easily recognized by their trunk, large ears, and tusks.
