                    <strong>The elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>)</strong> is the largest land animal on Earth and a member of the family Elephantidae. African elephants are distinguished by their large ears, which help to regulate their body temperature. Males can weigh up to 6,000 kg (13,200 lb).

                    Wild elephants are found in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. They inhabit savannas, forests, deserts, and marshes. Their populations have declined due to habitat loss and poaching for ivory and meat.

                    <strong>The elephant is a vulnerable species</strong>, facing threats from habitat destruction and illegal hunting. Conservation efforts focus on anti-poaching measures and habitat preservation. African forest elephants are particularly endangered.
